A while loop follows a simple sequence of steps:

Evaluation of Test Expression: The loop begins by evaluating a test expression.
Condition Check: If the test expression is true, the code inside the loop's body is executed.
Re-evaluation: After executing the code, the test expression is evaluated again.

Optimising while loops involves making them more efficient by minimising unnecessary iterations. One common optimization technique is to use loop control statements like break or continue within the loop body.
