Time complexity:

When it will come?

- Consider me I am writing a code and for judging that code, time complexity and space complexity came into it
- I am being judged by analyzing time and space complexity of my code.


- Time complexity != Time taken by the code to run 

why?
Lets consider there are two systems
old windows 
new macbook 

when I run my code in both of this, my time taken will be
old windows - 2 seconds
new macbook - 1 seconds {due to latest technological configruations}

So,In this case, 
The time complexity of any code depends on the configruations of the system where it is being ran.

Hence, Time complexity != Time taken by the code

Then What is time complexity?
 - The rate at which time taken increases with respect to the input size rather

Consider two systems:
old windows 
new macbook

In old windows,
consider input size(x axis) and time taken (y axis) - graph

at input 10,time taken - 2 seconds
at input 20,time taken - 4 seconds
at input 30,time taken - 6 seconds

connecting those dots,we got a slope and angle between x axis and slope line is theta (rate of increase)


In new macbook,
consider input size(x axis) and time taken (y axis) - graph

at input 10,time taken - 1 seconds
at input 20,time taken - 2 seconds
at input 30,time taken - 3 seconds

connecting those dots,we got a slope and angle between x axis and slope line is theta (rate of increase)

So the rate at which time taken increases  -is called time complexity.

Time complexity is measured in :
- Big O notation
O(timetaken)
